/**
 * You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and
 * S representing the stones you have. Each character in S is a type of stone
 * you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 * 
 * The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
 * letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of
 * stone from "A".
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb" Output: 3 Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ" Output: 0
