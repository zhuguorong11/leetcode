/**
 * Given a string that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can
 * replace any letter in the string with another letter at most k times. Find
 * the length of a longest substring containing all repeating letters you can
 * get after performing the above operations.
 * 
 * Note: Both the string's length and k will not exceed 104.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa. Example 2:
 * 
 * Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
 * 
 * Output: 4
 * 
 * Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
 * The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
