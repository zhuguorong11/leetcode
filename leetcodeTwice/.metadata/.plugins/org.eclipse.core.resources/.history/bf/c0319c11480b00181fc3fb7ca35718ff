/**
 * Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous
 * increasing subsequence (subarray).
 * 
 * Example 1: Input: [1,3,5,4,7] Output: 3 Explanation: The longest continuous
 * increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. Even though [1,3,5,7] is
 * also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are
 * separated by 4. Example 2: Input: [2,2,2,2,2] Output: 1 Explanation: The
 * longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
